# 8051-With-external-EEPROM-and-UART-Communication
This project uses the AT89C51 microcontroller with an external 24C02 EEPROM (I2C), a 16x2 LCD display, and UART for communication. It is simulated in Proteus 8.11 and developed in Keil uVision 5, demonstrating data storage, display, and serial communication
